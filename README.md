Sungka
======

A simple simulation of sungka, a traditional game in the Philippines.
* 10/28/2014.  PDF text about sungka and the code now live.
* 10/28/2014. A simulation of 1,000 games shows the number of turns required to finish a game is normally distributed, but the margin of victory is NOT.  The distribution looks exponential.  I don't know what that means, though. :D
* 10/28/2014. Code is clean and documented.  Stats from 1,000 games in PDF.  A short description of project coming up.
